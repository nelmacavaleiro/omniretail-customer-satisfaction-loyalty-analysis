This repository presents an analytical Power BI dashboard developed for the **DataDNA Challenge – July 2025**, focused on understanding customer satisfaction and loyalty patterns at *OmniRetail*, a U.S. omnichannel retailer of electronics and smart home products.

The analysis explores how satisfaction scores vary across demographics, regions, loyalty levels, purchasing behaviour, and customer support interactions, using a dataset provided by the challenge organisers.
